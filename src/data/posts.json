The nature of the disorder, characterized by concentration difficulties, impulsivity, lack of motivation (due to low dopamine production) and sometimes hyperactivity, can come into direct conflict with the demands of coding, which require intense focus and attention to detail, or even agility and detachment."

It manifests itself in various ways: postponing the start of a project, leaving bugs to be fixed “later”, or continually reorganizing the list of tasks without actually starting any of them, or in my case, starting the project from scratch over and over again, trying to regain my train of thought."

Although I'd had the idea for a long time, I always found a reason to put it off: “I need to learn more about design first”, “I'll wait until I have more content”, or “Now isn't the right time”, “It's almost done, I just need to refactor it”.

What was once a healthy desire to do a good job became a relentless pursuit of unattainable perfection.
